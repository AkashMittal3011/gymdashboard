2. Member Self-Registration via QR

Generate a QR code in the admin dashboard using a library like react-qr-code.

QR code encodes a URL like https://mygymapp.com/register?gymId=123.

When members scan it, they open a registration form with fields:

Name, Contact (phone/email), Age, Plan selection.

On submission, data is stored in DB and linked to that gym.

Admin dashboard updates in real time with new members.

JWT-based authentication for gym owners.

Gym owners must log in to access the dashboard.

Optionally, members can log in to view their:

Subscription status.

Payment history.

Attendance history.

4. Attendance Tracking (QR Check-in)

Each member has a unique QR code ID.

Gym scans this code on entry (or member self-scans).

Attendance is logged in DB with timestamp.

Admin can see attendance history in member profiles.

5. Payment Integration

Integrate Stripe or Razorpay for membership payments.

Admin defines membership plans (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Members pay online via UPI, card, or wallet.

Backend tracks:

Payment status (pending, paid, failed).

Generates downloadable receipts (PDF/email).

Payment history stored in database.
